            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Author is by Face wholly unknown to us; but we have with much satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and delight perused his ensuing Treatise, finding it to be solid and judicious, and full of Scripture-light and strength, and singularly adapted and suited to enlighten and establish plain Christians, whose Consciences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by, and Faith bottomed on the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his Opinion, that nothing should be sung in Publick Worship but <hi>Scripture</hi> Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Hymns of <hi>humane</hi> composure by a private Gift, which some sing in their solemn Assemblies; We do freely concur with him; and heartily wish that those who practise other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, would a little better consider what they do. We know not any thing that such can alledge for their way, seeing God hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished us with such a full supply of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Songs of his own inditing, and seeing there is not any intimation in the Scripture that it was ever practised among the People of God of old.</p>

            <p>But if ye judge that these and the like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures are not a sufficient <hi>Rule</hi> for Singing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Psalms, then what do you think was the De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206092:4"/> of the Holy Ghost in writing them? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye will not say, it was that all the Churches (except a few <hi>Antipaedo-baptists</hi>) should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, and so led into <hi>Popery,</hi> (for so you term Singing of Psalms) this were Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to affirm; but ye have not so learned Christ. When some of those Scriptures in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament were brought for a <hi>Rule</hi> for singing of Psalms, to avoid their force (because ye could not answer them) you put them by, saying, These are Old Testament Texts, and we must not go to the Old Testament for <hi>Worship:</hi> Which is your Second <hi>Objection.</hi>

            <p>If you are not to go to the Old Testament for <hi>Worship,</hi> then ye are not <hi>under the Law to Christ,</hi> as the Law is a Rule of Life: For the first Table concerns <hi>Worship,</hi> and you cannot go to that as a Rule without going to it <hi>as a Rule of Worship:</hi> Neither can ye be obliged to, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the Duty of Prayer, (or any other Duty to God) by any of the Precepts or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the Old Testament, if you are not to go to them for <hi>Worship.</hi> Thus to maintain one Error you run into another, and do as <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> of whom the Lord complaineth, <hi>Hos. 8. 12. I have written to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ and his Apostles did go to the Old Testament for <hi>Worship,</hi> Mat. 4. 10. 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16, 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. from the first to the twelfth <hi>Verse,</hi> also the <hi>18th. 19th.</hi> and <hi>20th.

            <p>And some have observed, that the <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> themselves, when they Preach about the Duty of Prayer, or when they keep publick Fasts, do make more use of Old Testament Texts, and less of the New than many others do; which proves (when it is for their turn) they will make use of the Old Testament for

               <hi>Worship,</hi> as much as others; only upon a pinch, to maintain either of their two <hi>Errours,</hi> they will deny going to the Old Testament for <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> as hath been often observed: But Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Proofs will still remain to be good New Testament Rules in this, as well as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Cases; for <hi>the Scriptures cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> John 10. 35. Therefore <hi>believe his Prophets, so shall ye prosper,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Where do ye prove that singing of Psalms was practised in the New Testament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer. 1. We shall prove from the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Precepts delivered by way of Prophesie in the Old Testament, that it was the Duty of the Churches under the New Testament to sing Psalms;</hi> and that is enough for our purpose. 2. <hi>Shew that the Spirit of God did give forth several Songs in the New Testament. 3. That this Ordinance of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is commanded in the New Testament. 4. That in the New Testament we have several directions given us how to sing. 5.

            <p>2dly. <hi>The Spirit of God did continue to give forth several songs in the New Testament;</hi> which doth strongly argue that this Ordinance of singing was to continue under the New Testament: The Song of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> recorded in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 46. to 55. <hi>ver.</hi> the Song of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> Luk. 1. from 67, to the 79 verse, the Song of <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luke 2▪ 28, to the 32 ver.</p>

            <p>3dly. <hi>This Ordinance of singing of Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, is commanded in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> In <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. the Spirit of God by the Apostle saith, that we Gentiles are to have sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst us, and are to glorifie God for his mercy, <hi>ver. 9.

            <p>If you compare <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 22. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. and then both with Christ and his Disciples singing together, it will be most probable that they sung <hi>as a Church,</hi> especially if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd that they had (in the same meeting) the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> for where <hi>that is rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister'd,</hi> (as be sure then it was) <hi>it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily supposeth a Church:</hi> Yea, they were the first New Testament Church, and so a Pattern or Example to all Churches in after Ages; and it would be very <hi>bold</hi> for any to say, that we <hi>must</hi> not, and they <hi>will</hi> not follow the Example of our Lord and his Apostles, in <hi>singing</hi> as well as in <hi>breaking of bread:</hi> But it would be <hi>worse</hi> for any to charge Christ and his Apostles with <hi>Popery</hi> for singing; yet thus they will charge the Churches now, for following of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. But our Lord Jesus hath commanded us to follow his Example in singing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. a Psalm of Christ's Sufferings, and where he is brought in speaking; he first declares that he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206092:10"/> will sing Praise, (as he did <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 30.) then commands all that fear God to do so too, <hi>22d.</hi> and <hi>23d. ver. In the midst of the Congregation,</hi> (or Church, as <hi>Heb. 2. 12.) will I praise thee,</hi> (then speaks to us) <hi>ye that fear the Lord praise him, all ye seed of Jacob glorifie him:</hi> That by Praise here is meant singing of Praise, the Holy Ghost himself telleth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. see also the <hi>25th.</hi> and <hi>26th.</hi> verses of this <hi>22d.</hi> Psalm, where our Lord doth again declare he will praise, and promises that we shall do so too; yea, in the <hi>3d.</hi> verse it is spoke of as one of God's Titles, (<hi>O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel!</hi>) and therefore it could not be typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and so cease as Types do.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> sang Praises unto God, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25. they did sing with the voice, for the Prisoners heard them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15. I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also:</hi> By singing with the Spirit we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand singing by the help of the Spirit of God, and with Faith, Intention, Joy, and Fervour in his own Soul, in opposition to a formal, trifling Spirit. By singing with the understanding, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with such Words, and in such Language, as that others might understand him. It is plain from the whole Chapter that he is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon them the orderly performance of preaching, praying, and also <hi>singing</hi> in the publick Worship of the Church, which proves both that they had, and also that they ought to have <hi>singing of Psalms, Prayer</hi> and <hi>preaching
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206092:11"/> the Word,</hi> as the three standing Ordinances for Publick Worship under the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the <hi>Revelations,</hi> (which is a prophetical History of the Church, from that time to the end of the World) we have account that they did, and shall sing in the several ages of the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8, 11. and 5. 9, 10. and 15. 3. and 19. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Thus Brethren, ye have had the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures given you for a Rule for singing of Psalms, and also to prove that this Ordinance was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed under the New Testament; but yet if ye do not believe them, ye will not sing Psams, for indeed (to be plain with you) that is the true Reason why ye do not sing, though ye have not hit on't amongst your Objections; <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. and the last verse, with the <hi>15th.</hi> Chapter and the <hi>1st.</hi> verse, <hi>And the People feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and his Servant Moses, then sang Moses and the Children of Israel this Song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psalm▪ 106. 12. Then believed they his words, they sang his praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>We may as well pray by a Form as sing by a Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi> 1. We readily grant (for any thing we see to the contrary) that 'tis Mens Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Will-worship, to perform to God Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship in the Church, by singing of any form or forms whatsoever, that are invented and composed by the common Gifts of any Man, or Men, (though never so holy) if he or they were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:206092:11"/> not inspired by the Holy Ghost for that end, and therefore we own that (for any thing we yet see) we may (in the publick Worship of God) as well pray by a form of Man's Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as sing by a form of Man's Invention; but we believe you know our Practice, which is to sing those <hi>Psalms, Hymns and Songs only,</hi> that were indited by the Spirit of God, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament; and indeed it was one of those that was sung at the time when, place where, and against which ye made these Objections: And therefore we conclude your Meaning is, that we may as well pray by a form of Mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, as sing by such Scripture forms, as you call them; and we will not dispute about the word Form, but admit it, if it be taken in a good Sence.</p>
            <p>And then why should ye be against forms in Worship, where it hath pleased the Wisdom of our Lord to appoint them, as he hath done for <hi>singing,</hi> though not for any <hi>other</hi> Ordinance of the New Testament; the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>singing</hi> being of such a Nature that it is not possible it should be observed without a <hi>Form;</hi> for <hi>many</hi> do joyn <hi>together</hi> in it, and that not only with their hearts, as in Prayer, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with their <hi>Voices;</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks, <hi>Isa. 52. 8. With the voice together shall they sing:</hi> But in all <hi>other</hi> Ordinances of Worship such a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of voices</hi> would make a confused <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> and hinder Edification.

               <hi>12ly. David</hi>'s, and the other <hi>Prophet's Psalms, and Songs,</hi> &amp;c. were known and called by the Name of <hi>The Songs of Zion,</hi> and <hi>The Lords Songs,</hi> which shews they were for the publick use of the Church, <hi>Psal. 137. 3. They required of us a song;</hi> (did not bid them compose one, but) <hi>they said, sing us one of the Songs of Zion,</hi> Ver. the <hi>4th.</hi> How shall we sing <hi>The Lord's Song,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 27. And when the Burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>13ly.</hi> Likewise when we are call'd to sing to God, we are not bid to <hi>make,</hi> but to <hi>take</hi> a Psalm, <hi>Psal. 81. 1, 2. Sing aloud to God our strength, take a Psalm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>14ly.</hi> Accordingly we find often in Scripture, when they were to sing, they did take one of the Psalms in the Psalm-book, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. tho' here is but one verse set down in the History, yet it is very probable that they sung <hi>most,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> of the <hi>136th.</hi> Psalm, and while they were sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they had a glorious token of God's gracious acceptance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 13, 14. we have the like account 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 21, 22. and here is but one <hi>verse</hi> likewise mentioned, yet it is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that they went on singing of <hi>more,</hi> by these Words, <hi>And when they began to sing and to praise;</hi> and it should seem they did very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon extraordinary occasions sing this <hi>136th.</hi> Psalm, see also 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 3. and <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 10, 11. yea, it seems fore-told that this <hi>Psalm</hi> should be sung under the New Testament, <hi>Jer. 33. 11th.</hi> verse, compar'd with the 15 and 16 <hi>verses</hi> of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206092:14"/> the same Chapter, and in the Texts of the <hi>Evangelist</hi> before-mentioned. The <hi>Whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of the Disciples did praise God with a <hi>loud voice,</hi> with a part at least of the <hi>118th. Psalm,</hi> though it is most likely they sung it all, by the time they were praising God, which was both in their way from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and also after they came into the Temple. It need not seem strange, that there is in these places but a verse or two (and not the whole Psalm) repeated in the History, though it should be meant that they sung the whole Psalm, for we have a like Instance in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 20, 21. and here (we suppose) none will deny but that they sung all the Song which the Men did sing, though only the first verse of it be repeated.</p>
            <p>Yet which is more plain, we read that they did sing the 15 first verses of the <hi>105th. Psalm,</hi> and the <hi>96th. Psalm,</hi> both at a time, 1 <hi>Chron. 16th.</hi> Chap. and this was done by the Prophet <hi>David</hi>'s appointment; and here you have not a verse only but the whole repeated, and this place may warrant the <hi>singing of part of a Psalm,</hi> or <hi>part of several Psalms</hi> at the same time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Matter of them is suited to the present Occasion: And the New Testament Church is said to sing the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> Rev. 15. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>15ly.</hi> The Title of the <hi>92d. Psalm,</hi> is, <hi>a Psalm or Song for the sabbath-day,</hi> which shews that this very Psalm was written for <hi>publick use,</hi> and is to be sung on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and also that <hi>Singing is an ordinance, ordinarily to be performed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206092:14"/> on the Sabbath,</hi> the two first verses commend it for <hi>A good thing to sing praises,</hi> and to do it both in the <hi>Morning and Evening</hi> of the Sabbath es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, for the which this is a Psalm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>16thly.</hi> The <hi>26th.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Isa.</hi> is a <hi>Song,</hi> and this very Song is to be sung now under the New Testament, signify'd by the term <hi>that day,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> the first, <hi>In that day shall this Song be sung,</hi> and we are <hi>in that day,</hi> and therefore are to sing it, (notwithstanding your Objection about sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a form) yea, <hi>that day</hi> here meant, being the Gospel-day, doth last until the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> see <hi>verse</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>17thly.</hi> And in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time (which was many Generations after <hi>David,</hi> Mat. 1. 6, 7, 8, 9.) the Text is so clear, as <hi>Nothing can be clearer for singing of Scripture-Psalms;</hi> here is both a plain <hi>command</hi> for it, and also a <hi>President</hi> they did do it, 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 30. Hezekiah the King and the Princes commanded the Levites,</hi> (who were chief Leaders of the People in this work) <hi>to sing praise unto the Lord with the Words of David and of Asaph, and they sang praises with gladness:</hi> Were not their words as much a form in <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s <hi>time</hi> as they are <hi>now?</hi> what? could not <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> nor his <hi>Princes,</hi> nor <hi>Levites,</hi> (think you) by their common Gifts have invented an Hymn (as they are now call'd?) yea, the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> was then living with them, who did by a spirit of Inspiration write several Songs, as appears by his Book? Surely then it was not out of meer necessity of want of others, (but because it was <hi>an ordinance of God, and right in his sight,</hi> verse 2. <hi>to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206092:15"/> sing with the words of David and Asaph</hi>) that the King and the Princes gave this command to sing Praise unto the Lord <hi>with the words of Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vid and of Asaph the Seer;</hi> mark that, with the words of <hi>Asaph the Seer;</hi> but why should it be said with the words of <hi>Asaph,</hi> the Seer, (or Prophet) and not also with the Words of <hi>David</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? upon the very naming of <hi>David</hi> all could understand the Prophet <hi>David</hi> was meant, but we read of several other <hi>Asaphs</hi> in Scripture, but we must sing the words of that <hi>Asaph</hi> only who was the <hi>Seer;</hi> no <hi>Asaph</hi>'s Words are fit matter for singing, but the Words of <hi>Asaph</hi> the <hi>Seer;</hi> this Text shews us, that when we sing Praise, <hi>We must see to it, that we sing with the words of those who were inspired by the spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> At the Institution of the Lord's Supper, Christ and his Apostles did sing a Hymn or Psalm, but it is not said it was a Scripture one, or an inspired one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi> 1. We read they sung a <hi>Hymn,</hi> or <hi>Psalm;</hi> and we read of none called <hi>so</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but those indited by the Holy Ghost, and recorded in Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. If Christ did compose one upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, it makes nothing against us, for we hope none will deny Christ to have had an <hi>infallible▪</hi> Spirit to guide him in it; then what is this to singing of those indited by the common Gifts of Men? But we conclude that Christ and his Apostles sung one, or more of <hi>David</hi>'s, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Scripture Psalms;</hi> because, if Christ had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this extraordinary occasion indited one, we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:206092:15"/> believe the Evangelists would have recorded the very words of it, for they did record those of <hi>Mary, Zacharias, Simeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It hath been <hi>objected</hi> by some, that most of the Scripture Psalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are written in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and are too <hi>Legal</hi> for this New Dispensation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Is there not cause to fear, least that Spirit which is elevated above <hi>Scripture strains,</hi> would be found too <hi>light</hi> and <hi>airy</hi> if weighed in the even Ballance of the Sanctuary? But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>18ly.</hi> We must sing <hi>Scripture Psalms, Hymns and Songs,</hi> for there are several uses and ends of the Ordinance of singing (which are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us) that cannot be fully (if at all) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, unless the matter of our Song be the Word of God. It is an Ordinance for our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> as appears by the Titles of the Psalms; many of which are thus, <hi>A Psalm to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:</hi> And when we sing them, we <hi>speak to our selves in Psalms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. And <hi>teach and admonish one another in Psalms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Colos. 3. 16. Deut.</hi> 31. 19, &amp;c. When the very <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of our Song is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and that which <hi>he hath appointed</hi> to be in our mouth to sing, <hi>while it is in our mouth,</hi> singing of it, '<hi>tis to be a Witness</hi> for God against us, if we are in evils; and for this end it was God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Moses</hi> to write and teach them this Song re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the <hi>32d. Chap. Now therefore write ye This Song</hi> (he doth not bid them <hi>invent</hi> and compose one by their common Gifts, <hi>but write This Song) for you, and teach i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Children of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:206092:16"/> Israel,</hi> (God doth appoint the <hi>Song</hi> as well as the <hi>Ʋse</hi> of it) <hi>put it in their mouths, that this Song may be a Witness,</hi> &amp;c. read the 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, <hi>verses</hi> of this 31 <hi>Deut.</hi> Now how can we expect that God should bless the singing of those Forms that are of <hi>humane invention</hi> unto us for those <hi>ends,</hi> to <hi>instruct</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> us, to <hi>admonish</hi> us of our Duty and against Sin, to <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and testifie</hi> against our Evils? Can Mens <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> forms be supposed to have like Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon the <hi>Conscience</hi> with the Word of God? therefore <hi>Let his statutes be our songs,</hi> Psal. 119. 54.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is not of Faith is sin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. How can we perform Worship to God in <hi>Faith,</hi> when we offer him that which he hath not <hi>commanded,</hi> yea, may he not justly say, as once he did, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> Isa. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>Are those forms composed by <hi>Men,</hi> better than those indited by the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> Are any so bold to say they are? if not, but the contrary; then take a <hi>Caution,</hi> and consider what the Lord saith, in <hi>Mal. 1. 13. 14. Ye brought that which was torn, and the lamè, and the sick, thus ye brought an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, should I accept this of your hands, saith the Lord, but cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing, for I am a great King, saith the Lord of Hosts, and my Name is dreadful among the Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have been proving, <hi>That we are to sing by a form, and by Scripture ones only:</hi> And to conclude this Head, if the Congregation might
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:206092:16"/> not sing with a <hi>form,</hi> how then could they ever sing with the <hi>voice together,</hi> as is foretold they should, <hi>Isa. 52. 8, 9. With the voice together shall they sing—and sing together,</hi> &amp;c. But how should they all know what is to be sung with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>form?</hi> and if they do not <hi>all know,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>all sing with the voice together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>We must not sing Psalms when there is a mixed company of Ʋnbelievers present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Pray what need of this <hi>Objection,</hi> when you are not for singing of Psalms at all? If they be <hi>absent</hi> ye will not sing, yet if they be <hi>present</hi> ye will lay your fault at their door.</p>
            <p>But all the Ordinances of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> for his <hi>publick</hi> Worship in the Church, are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Church as a Church,</hi> and no rule in God's Word to omit them, or any of them, when and because Unbelievers are present, nor to give over any part of publick Worship in the Church, when Unbelievers come into their Assemblies, but quite the contrary, <hi>Mat. 5. 16. Let your Light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father:</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. <hi>The Church of the living God, the pillar and the ground of the Truth.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:206092:17"/> 34. 8. and 49. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 96. 1, 9. and 7. 11, 12.) which doth suppose that <hi>they</hi> may be present when the Church doth sing them. Yea, further, the Church in singing these and other such like places, do (while they are prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God) as it were turn their Speech to <hi>Ʋnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> to exhort them to Faith and Obedience: And we singing only <hi>Scripture</hi> Psalms, Hymns, and Songs, which are the <hi>Word of God,</hi> may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have it blessed to them; and could (if need were) instance in several Persons, to whom God did bless this Ordinance in their first <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:</hi> It is the <hi>Lord's Word,</hi> though <hi>published by a great company</hi> in singing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 11.</p>
            <p>The fore-mentioned Scriptures, which speaks of the whole <hi>multitude</hi> of the Disciples (which includes the Apostles) crying <hi>Hosanna to the Son of David, and praising of God with a loud voice,</hi> do prove that they did it <hi>publickly</hi> in a vast and mixed company, both upon the way from the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and also in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and they had our <hi>Lord's presence</hi> to countenance them in it, and he silenced the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees who found fault. Read the places,</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Corin. 14. 14, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26. verses;</hi> It is evident from this Chapter, (as was said) 1. That in the <hi>publick</hi> Worship of the Church, they had Prayer▪ Preaching the Word, and also <hi>singing of Psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> 2. That there was disorders in the practice of each of them, which hinder'd Edification: And, 3. That this Chapter is spent (not to take any of these Ordinances away, but) to set these <hi>Corinthians</hi> (and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:206092:17"/> us) right in the performance of each of them. And one ground upon which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle urgeth them to the orderly performance of Praying, Preaching, and <hi>Singing,</hi> is, because of <hi>Ʋnbelievers</hi> coming into their Assemblies, (the <hi>23d.</hi> ver. and the <hi>26th.</hi> compar'd) which proves <hi>That we are to sing,</hi> (and that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did so) <hi>notwithstanding the presence of Ʋnbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any further <hi>Object,</hi> and say, If unbelievers may be present when we sing Psalms, they will join with the voice, and so sing with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> What if they do? where are they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid? or where have the Church authority from Christ to forbid them, or a command not to sing in their presence unless they will be silent? but on the contrary, doth not the Church rather stir them up to sing, and that by or in the very act of singing of such Passages as these, <hi>66th. Psal. 1, 2, 4, 8. Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye Lands, sing forth the honour of his Name, make his praise glorious; all the Earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee, they shall sing unto thy Name: O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard;</hi> this is joining with the voice, <hi>Psal. 96. 1. O sing unto the Lord a new song, sing unto the Lord all ye Earth,</hi> Psal. 117. 1. <hi>O praise the Lord all ye nations, praise him all ye people;</hi> see also <hi>Psal.</hi> 100. 1, 2. and 67. 3, 4, 5. and 68. 32. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 23. these Scriptures do encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, yea, exhort them to sing, and who then shall forbid them?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 37. it is said, <hi>The whole multitude
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:206092:18"/> of the Disciples began to rejoice, and to praise God with a loud voice,</hi> &amp;c. By whole <hi>multitude</hi> of Disciples cannot be meant the Apostles and the Seventy only, but also Disciples at large, all that did follow the Lord Christ to hear his Word, though not really converted, yet these did join with the Voice to praise God; indeed the Pharisees were offended at it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 15. (perhaps because they would not join with a mixed company, as was prophesied of them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 5. compared with 1, 2. <hi>ver.</hi> In the <hi>39th.</hi> ver. of this <hi>19th.</hi> Luke, <hi>Some of the Pharises from among the multitude said, Master, rebuke thy Disciples,</hi> (but) <hi>he answered, I tell you, if these should hold their peace, the stones would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cry out:</hi> Here we see our Lord doth countenance the multitude in joining with their voice to praise God, and silences those that find fault too.</p>
            <p>And though true Believers can do it best, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 10. yet it is the Duty of others also to praise and glorifie God, and they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing it; and in Scripture, yea, in the New Testament, we often read that they did praise and glorifie him, <hi>Luk. 18. 43. Mat.</hi> 9. 8. and 15. 31. <hi>Mar. 2. 12. Luk.</hi> 4. 15. and 5. 26. and 7. 16. and 19. 37. And Natural Worship, performed by Men as Men, may have a kind of acceptance, so far as to the diverting of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Judgments, as in the Case of <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Ninevites, 1 Kings 21. 29. Jonah</hi> 3. chap. see also 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 12, 14. And when Men, <hi>as Men,</hi> or as rational Creatures, do perform
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:206092:18"/> Worship to God as Creator, Preserver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may not the Spirit of God come and work Faith in their Hearts, and enable them <hi>as Believers</hi> to Worship God in Christ? is not this often done for them when they are hearing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel? And we have known it done when they have been singing too, as was said, The Word of God sung, as well as preached, may be made powerful to Conversion. As to that <hi>Objection</hi> of making the words their own, and so <hi>singing</hi> of a lye, there is nothing in it; and upon the same ground you may as well deny them the <hi>reading</hi> of Psalms, for then they say <hi>We, Ʋs,</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> as much as in <hi>singing</hi> of them, so you may as well say, they <hi>read</hi> a lye, as that they <hi>sing</hi> a lye. But they that make these <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> forget that Prayer and Praises are Natural Worship, and so the Duty of all Men; of Men as Men, and why they may not be present when we sing, whose Duty it is to sing as well as our own, is worth the while to consider.</p>
            <p>You say we must not sing Psalms when <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers</hi> are present; but the Prophet <hi>David</hi> being of another mind, it is but Justice to hear both sides: And it must be confessed that <hi>David</hi> hath one great Advantage on his side, (enough to sway with us) because (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21.)

            <p>There is one further End and Use of Singing which cannot be answered, unless the Church in their publick Worship may sing when <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers</hi> are present, which is to declare and shew forth the Name and Works of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Isa. 12. 4, 5.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:206092:19"/> for our Salvation, as appears by the whole Chapter, (which is a Song of the Church) read the <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>3d. verses:</hi> Psal. 9. 1, 2, 11. <hi>I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart, I will shew forth all thy marvellous works—I will sing praise to thy Name, O thou most high—Sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth in Zion, declare among the people his doings:</hi> Psal. 96. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Sing unto the Lord a new song, sing unto the Lord all the Earth, sing unto the Lord, bless his Name, shew forth his salvation from day to day, declare his Glory</hi> among the Heathen, <hi>his Wonders</hi> among all People; <hi>For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised:</hi> Psal. 105. 1, 2. <hi>Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his Name, make known his Deeds</hi> among the People; <hi>Sing unto him, sing Psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</hi> Now these Texts do prove that it is the Duty of the Church to sing Psalms when others are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and for glorious Ends too.</p>

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2, 5. tells us twice over, that <hi>Moses was faithful in the House of God,</hi> yet he could sing when a <hi>mixed company</hi> were present; yea, he was Head and Chief in the Work, when the <hi>whole</hi> Congregation of <hi>Israel,</hi> Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, sung that Song in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. and there was then a <hi>mixed company</hi> with them, as you may see, if you compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 37, 38. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second of Hosea</hi> is a Prophecy of New-Testament-Times, as is plain by comparing the <hi>23d.</hi> verse with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 26. and with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. and in this <hi>second of Hosea</hi> we are very

And I will give her her Vineyards from thence, and the Valley of Achor for a door of Hope, and she shall sing there as in the days of her Youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the Land of Egypt:</hi> This Text (as well as many others) doth shew, that the true Church is always one and the same, both under the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: <hi>Give her her Vineyards,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as when she came up,</hi> &amp;c. Only during the time of the Old Testament she was in the days of her youth, and under the Old Church Covenant or Dispensation, see <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28, 29. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 24, 25, 26. and this first Covenant is said to be the Covenant with them in the days of their youth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 60. under which Covenant they were <hi>As Children under age, until Christ came,</hi> Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. or until the New-Testament-times, signified by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, whom the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church was to receive as her Sisters, but not by their Covenant, that's now at an end, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 60, 61. and then again <hi>ver.</hi> 62. the Covenant is promis'd to be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as everlasting, never to give place to any more New Dispensations: And she shall sing <hi>There as in the days of her youth;</hi> here it is said the Church did sing <hi>In the days of her youth,</hi> under the Old Testament, which is abundantly proved in the Scriptures. But now in this Text here is <hi>another time</hi> set for the Church to sing, and put after, and by way of distinction from the days of <hi>her youth,</hi> (or being under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:206092:20"/> which must mean the time of her <hi>full age</hi> under the New; <hi>She shall sing there as in the days of her youth:</hi> And then leads us to a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Instance of her singing, and <hi>as in the day</hi> (not days, as the other) <hi>when she came up out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> an account of which we have in the 14, &amp; 15. Chapters of <hi>Exod.</hi> neither is this the only place where the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> is put to signifie the <hi>Days of the Gospel,</hi> see <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 1, 10. and as it was the place or door where the People of <hi>Israel</hi> first entered <hi>Canaan,</hi> and so gave them hope of Rest in the good Land, so is it here called a <hi>Door of Hope</hi> to us under the New Testament, compare it with <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 27. and with 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 8, 9. And she shall sing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the Land of Egypt:</hi> This one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth fully answer all the former <hi>Objections</hi> against singing of Psalms. <hi>1st.</hi> They sung when they came up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 15. and they sung often under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the days of their <hi>youth,</hi> and this Text bids us sing <hi>as they did;</hi> here is a <hi>Rule for sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 2dly. <hi>We must go to the Old Testament for Worship;</hi> for we are bid to sing as they did, therefore we must go thither to see how they sung. <hi>3dly.</hi> This proves <hi>they sung in the New Testament,</hi> for here it is foretold they should sing as the Church did under the Old Testament, and the <hi>Scripture must be fulfilled:</hi> And as they sung when they came up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they are said to sing the Song of <hi>Moses, Rivel.</hi> 15. 3. 4ly. <hi>We are to sing with a form, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:206092:21"/> a Scripture one too,</hi> for we are to sing as they did, and they sung with the words of <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Asaph</hi> the Seer; and the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> is sung, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 3. 5ly. <hi>We are to sing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the presence of Ʋnbelievers;</hi> for they did so, (as hath been proved) and we are to sing as they did.</p>
            <p>Objection. <hi>Ʋnder the Old Testament sometimes they made use of Instruments of Musick when they sung:</hi> And if we are to sing as they did, then we must have Musick too. <hi>Answer.</hi> Yes, so we must have our <hi>Harps,</hi> when we sing Psalms, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8, 9. &amp; 14. 2, 3. &amp; 15. 2, 3, 4. that is, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in our Hearts,</hi> which their Musick did typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. which place seems purposely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prevent, or to answer this <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> For these <hi>Ephesians,</hi> (and so others also) might have said, you exhort us to sing Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, which are the Titles of the Scripture Psalms, but under the Old Testament some of these were sung with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, must not we sing them with Musick too? Yes, says the Apostle, but let it be in your <hi>Heart, Singing and making melody in your Heart to the Lord:</hi> This place doth (as we think) repeal, and take away the use of all outward Musick, except that of the Voice; the New Testament requires only fit <hi>Matter,</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi> in singing, and where these <hi>three</hi> are, the Exhortations to singing are answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obeyed. But observe, that this <hi>Objection</hi> is not now made with design to bring <hi>Musick</hi> into the Church, but to cast <hi>singing</hi> out: They
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:206092:21"/> say, Musick was used when they sung, but Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick is at an end, and why not singing too? If this be good arguing, go on; <hi>Incense</hi> was used with <hi>Prayer,</hi> but if we must not offer <hi>Incense</hi> now, but that is at an end, then why not <hi>praying</hi> too, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11. according to this way of reasoning you may quickly have done with <hi>prayer</hi> as well as <hi>singing.</hi> Musick was but an outward <hi>Ceremony,</hi> or Type, of that Joy of Heart with which the same Psalms were to be sung under the New Testament, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. and was no <hi>essential</hi> part of this Ordinance of singing of Psalms; and all the ends and uses of singing of Psalms are preserved and answered without it; besides we find the Ordinance of singing often commanded and practised in the New Testament, but we never find there a Command to sing with Musick, nor one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that it was practised. Nay, indeed we do not find that <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> was ever practised under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues;</hi> to which, rather than to the <hi>Temple,</hi> our <hi>Meeting-houses</hi> answer; and yet in their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> they had all <hi>natural Worship,</hi> and some Learned Men do judge that their Musick was an Appendix to their Sacrifices.

            <p>God hath taken many ways for the manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his great and everlasting Love, and of his rich, free and distinguishing Grace to his Children and People, and shall any of them be so disingenuous as to say, what need is there of a distinct Ordinance for to praise him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they can do it in Prayer? <hi>Do ye thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord?</hi> Deut. 32. 6.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:206092:24"/> to sing generally out of their <hi>Hymn</hi>-Books (as they are called) but very rarely out of the <hi>Psalm</hi>-Book.</p>
            <p>We cannot believe that the Apostle in his Exhortations to sing <hi>Psalms, Hymns</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> would have placed the Word <hi>Hymns</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Words <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> if by <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> he had meant Scripture ones, and by <hi>Hymns</hi> quite other things, and especially because he hath both in <hi>Eph. 5. 19.

If <hi>Paul</hi> by Psalms, Hymns and Songs, or any one of them, doth intend any thing more than <hi>James</hi> doth by Psalms, then he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to sing other and different matter than <hi>James</hi> doth, which cannot be, because both were guided by the same Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now to prove that by the word <hi>Hymns</hi> (as well as by Psalms and Songs) is meant <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Psalms,</hi> We shall (as was said) produce the Testimony of some both Learned and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witnesses.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henry Ainsworth</hi> (in his Preface before his Annotations on the Psalms) saith, <q rend="inline">This Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> (most whereof <hi>David</hi> made) is a glorious Testimony, wherein by manifold <hi>Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and Spiritual <hi>Songs,</hi> he set forth the Praises of God.</q>

            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:206092:25"/>

            <p>Mr. <hi>John Cotton</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> saith, <q rend="inline">

            </p>
            <p>Again, he saith, <q rend="inline">The Apostle expresly nameth <hi>Psalms, Hymns,</hi> and Spiritual <hi>Songs,</hi> and they <hi>three</hi> are the very express Titles of the Psalms in the Psalm-Book,
